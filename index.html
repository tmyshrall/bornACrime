    <h1>Born a Crime Chapter Analysis</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="sectionTitle">Context</h2>
        <p class="sectionContent">When Trevor was in school on Valentine's Day, all of his friends told him he should ask Maylene to be his Valentine because she is the only mixed girl in his school, and they were often seen walking home from school together. Once Trevor finally asked, Maylene said yes and agreed to be Trevor's Valentine. He saved up money to buy her gifts for Valentine's Day, but when the day came, she told Trevor that she could no longer be his girlfriend because another boy had asked Maylene to be his Valentine. This left Trevor's heart broken, yet Trevor understood why Maylene had picked this other boy.</p>

        <h2 class="sectionTitle">Analysis</h2>
        <p class="sectionContent">Trevor now realizes that relationships are more complex than he had initially thought and are not just something that can be earned. This event in his life now helps him see relationships are more based on mutual feelings. Trevor’s awkwardness during the breakup shows his insecurities shaped by his being mixed race, which was uncommon during the apartheid in South Africa. Trevor’s understanding of why Maylene picked the other boy reinforces his belief that he does not fit in. Since Maylene picked a white kid over Trevor, it's a reflection on the state of South Africa at the time. It was a time during a racial divide where people that were mixed had less status. Noah wants the reader to understand that painful moments of humiliation are universal, and like his breakup with Maylene, those moments can be turned into personal growth to help with many aspects of life.</p>

        <h2 class="sectionTitle">Quote 1</h2>
        <div class="quoteBox">
            <p class="quote">“As devastated as I was, I understood why Mylene made the choice that she did. I would have picked Lornzo over me too. All the other kids were running up and down the corridors and out on the playground, laughing and smiling with their red and pink cards and flowers, and I went back to the classroom and sat by myself and waited for the bell to ring.” (Noah 133)</p>
            <p class="annotation">Noah's tone is one of self reflection and introspection. “I would have picked Lornzo over me too.” This tone reflects the contrast between the happy kids running through the halls and Trevor sitting alone with feelings of isolation.</p>

        <h2 class="sectionTitle">Quote 2</h2>
        <div class="quoteBox">
            <p class="quote">“I was about to say ‘Happy Valentine's Day!’ when she stopped me and said,’Oh, hi, Trevor. Um, listen, I can't be your girlfriend anymore. Lorenzo asked me to be his valentine and I cant have two valentines, so i'm his girlfriend now and not yours.’” (Noah 132)</p>
            <p class="annotation">Noah's diction is very blunt and direct: "I can't have two Valentines." The directness of the dialogue highlights how painful and sudden the rejection is for Trevor.</p>
